# MICB 475: Data Science Research in Microbiology - Team 2 - Lab Notebook
This document contains summaries of what was done throughout the project
## February 11, 2024
John - Created README file. Imported and demultiplexed parkinsons sequences. Denoising, clusterng, taxonomic training, filtering, and export conducted.

Ali - Removed NAs from PD drug columns. Added "treatment" column numbered 1-7 for the following treatments:
control = 1
pd_untreated = 2
pd_entac = 3 
pd_prami = 4
pd_rasag = 5
pd_amant = 6
pd_combo = 7

### Visualization of sequences on view.qiime.org
All high quality reads throughout. Setting a standard of 30 for median quality score, no trimming is required. 251 is the trimming parameter and the length of all of the sequences. (John)
